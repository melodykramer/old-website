	<p class="lead" markdown="1">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Mel</span>. I design and then build products that help people learn, find information, or share what they've learned with others.</p>
	<p>I have more than a decade of experience working as a product manager, digital strategist, editor, writer, and producer. I've led both teams and projects â€” and come armed with skills ranging from editorial to product to business strategy. 
	<p>I lead audience growth and development for the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">Wikimedia Foundation.</a> I also write <a href="http://www.poynter.org/author/melody-kramer/">a weekly column</a> for the Poynter Institute</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time hiking, exploring small towns in North Carolina, and hanging out with A and our dog Sadie.</p>
