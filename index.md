	<p class="lead" markdown="1">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Mel</span>. I design and then build products that help people learn, find information, or share what they've learned with others.</p>
	<p>I have more than a decade of experience working as a product manager, digital strategist, editor, writer, and producer. I've led both teams and projects â€” and come armed with skills ranging from editorial to product to business strategy. 
	<p>I am currently serving a two-year term appointment at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, a digital design and technology agency within the U.S. government. I also write <a href="http://www.poynter.org/author/melody-kramer/">a weekly column</a> for the Poynter Institute and lead <a href="http://www.mediapublic.io">Media Public</a>, a public media startup that's funded through a Knight Prototype Grant.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time hiking, exploring small towns in North Carolina, and hanging out with A and our dog Sadie.</p>
