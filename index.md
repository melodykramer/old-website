	<p class="lead" markdown="1">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Mel</span>. I help people think about strategies for reaching new and existing audiences.</p>
	<p>I also work on a variety of side projects that usually have to do with public media, libraries, archives, free knowledge, and/or creating little bits of joy in people's lives.</p> 
	<p>I currently lead audience growth and development for the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">Wikimedia Foundation.</a> I also write <a href="http://www.poynter.org/author/melody-kramer/">a weekly column</a> for the Poynter Institute about innovation in the news industry. A long time ago, I directed and wrote jokes for Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time hiking, exploring small towns in North Carolina, and hanging out with A and our dog Sadie.</p>
