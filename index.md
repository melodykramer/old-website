	<p class="lead" markdown="1">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Mel</span>. I need to update this website. A long time ago, I directed and wrote jokes for NPR's Wait Wait Don't Tell Me. I've also led product teams, edited National Geographic, and repaired books in a rare books library. Outside of work, I spend a lot of time hiking, cooking, making quilts, and hanging out with my awesome family.</p>
