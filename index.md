	<p class="lead" markdown="1">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Mel</span>. I work on some of the trickiest problems in the news and information ecosystem.</p>
	<p>I currently lead audience growth and development for the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">Wikimedia Foundation</a>. I also write <a href="https://www.poynter.org/person/961/archive">a weekly column</a> for the Poynter Institute about innovation in the news industry, am leading a project to <a href="https://collaborativejournalism.org/database-search-sort-learn-collaborative-projects-around-world/">document every collaborative journalism project</a> in the world, and am a Visiting Fellow at UNC's Reese News Lab, where I'm <a href="https://cislm.org/announcing-first-reese-news-lab-fellow-melody-kramer/">researching how newsrooms</a> can use data to create sustainable revenue models. A long time ago, I directed and wrote jokes for NPR's Wait Wait Don't Tell Me. I've also led product teams, edited National Geographic, and repaired books in a rare books library. Outside of work, I spend a lot of time hiking, cooking, making quilts, and hanging out with my awesome family.</p>
