	<p class="lead" markdown="1">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Mel</span>. I help people and organizations think strategically about reaching new and existing audiences.</p>
	<p>I also work on a variety of side projects that usually have to do with public media, libraries, archives, free knowledge, using the Internet as a force for good, and/or creating little bits of joy in people's lives.</p> 
	<p>I currently lead audience growth and development for the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">Wikimedia Foundation</a>. I also write <a href="http://www.poynter.org/author/melody-kramer/">a weekly column</a> for the Poynter Institute about innovation in the news industry. A long time ago, I directed and wrote jokes for NPR's Wait Wait Don't Tell Me. I've also led product teams, edited National Geographic, and repaired books in a rare books library.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time hiking, quilting, exploring small towns in North Carolina, and hanging out with my awesome family, who don't spend much time online at all.</p>
